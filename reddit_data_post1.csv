Opacy,"It’s probably the right move - even with Apple’s deep pockets, building a brand new EV from scratch is hard. Scaling up manufacturing for mass production of that EV is hard. Creating a national or international sales and service network is hard and ridiculously expensive. Even if the car project is dead, I would still love to see Apple take another stab at EVs - maybe instead of going it alone, they would partner with an established manufacturer who would build an “Apple-designed” EV that is a showcase for Apple software - full next gen CarPlay, CarKey support, deep integration with Apple Watch and iPhone etc.

Depending on how serious Apple is about it, they could also do stuff like work with the manufacturer’s dealer network to choose specific dealerships across the country as partners to sell the Apple EV (at a set price Tesla-style with no haggling) and provide service and repairs. Ford is already doing something similar with their dealership network when it comes to selling their EVs (though they are having some difficulty)

All of this would be difficult, but I have to think it would be significantly cheaper and easier than building all of that from scratch.",2024-02-27 19:32:55,142

Autonomy was another angle that Apple could've approached this project, but the most autonomous full-stack vehicles are fleet vehicles like Cruise or Waymo.

YouAboutToLoseYoJob,"To be completely honest, upon my arrival, there were still numerous discussions ongoing regarding the final version of the project. Frankly, nobody was certain whether it would culminate in an autonomous vehicle, a taxi service, an Apple-branded production vehicle, or if we would eventually sell the technology to another entity. The speculation and confusion were rampant, and the constant restructuring led me to believe that this endeavor might not see fruition for another 7 to 8 years.

While my focus was primarily on autonomy, I did catch glimpses of the prototypes for the physical vehicle, notable for its unique steering wheel design resembling more of a flight controller than a conventional wheel.

Moreover, considering the incidents involving other autonomous platforms like Uber, Cruise, and Waymo, there was a prevailing sentiment within the lab that no matter how diligent our efforts, a single mishap could result in prolonged negative publicity. While the memory of the woman killed by an Uber car may have faded for many, and incidents involving Cruise in San Francisco may be overlooked, we couldn't afford anything less than absolute perfection.

In my belief, Our testing procedures far surpassed those of any other vehicle platform, yet from a financial standpoint, I struggled to see the profitability of a potential $80,000 to $100,000 car for Apple, considering profit margins.

Especially when you drive, it's really inconvenient, want to open a glove box? You have to play around the UI and do a couple of clicks to get to that, while driving this isn't convenient or safe and you will most probably just ask your passenger to do that for you.

Drive quality was also not impressive, and didn't feel as smooth as some of the other EVs I tested like polestar and etc.

I ended up with ioniq 5 limited, the interior is miles better, and It even has reclining seats.

bloomberg,"*From Bloomberg News reporter Mark Gurman:*

Apple is canceling a decadelong effort to build an electric car, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.

Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn’t public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.

The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the car team — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.

The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and vehicle designers. It’s possible they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.

The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort called Project Titan that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. You can read the full story [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai), or [sign up](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on) for Mark's Power On newsletter, free to read.",2024-02-27 21:45:31,3

There's a lot of struggle with EV's on things with a) getting electronic parts b) sourcing enough lithium for batteries c) expensive repair costs d) keeping the MSRP down compared to similar ICE cars. 

I was trying to buy a Honda Ioniq5 a couple years ago and I had a down payment and it was delayed 12 months before I just said, screw this, and went and bought an ICE. 

Then there was an article about a guy who owned on in Canada and they were going to charge him 60k in repair costs because the battery needed replacing. 

Mind you the car already sells for 60k and it's...Not a luxrious interior by any means, it's very ""plasticy"". It's fast as hell but that's a ""value"" that wears off after you show it off a few times, sure merging on the highway is great but no one ""needs"" 0-60 in under 4 seconds the majority of the time. Also it had no rear wiper, which was an issue. 

Anyways, just read an article a few days ago where Mercedes is joining a list of other car manufacturers who are scaling back EV production, in what was already a VERY small market (at least in the US/Canada)

Seems like an EV will add 30-50k to most sticker prices and people just don't care THAT much to warrant it.",2024-02-28 11:39:35,2

iMacmatician,"That's why Gruber keeps bringing up the ""Big Hack"" (or at least used to) even though he knows it has nothing to do with Gurman. 

John Gruber is well known for his Apple commentary (and Markdown). He is a longtime and well-respective member of the Apple community and has connections to Apple. He's comfortably in the highest ""tier"" of Apple commentators in terms of social status. While Gruber seems to have some sources (""little birdie""s), *Daring Fireball* is not a rumor site. Hence one can surmise that he knows little about future Apple products aside from what the (public) rumor mill is saying. 

On the other hand, Mark Gurman has sources within Apple, and rather good ones too. To a reasonable extent, he ""knows"" what Apple will do a few weeks to a few years from now. I'd place him at the top tier of rumor sites in the past 20 years, along with *ThinkSecret*, *AppleInsider*, and *9to5Mac* in their heydays. 

The Apple community generally likes to get information about upcoming products for various reasons, and rumors and rumor sites satisfy that itch. Many people can make informed speculation about Apple's future, but without inside sources, it's really hard to sustain the level of accuracy and precision of a good rumor site. 

>It's strange to see his fans carrying around his weird grudges too.\^

And here's where I think the Gruber–Gurman situation comes in. In the Apple sphere, the only person who can be ""better"" than a well-informed commentator is a well-connected rumormonger. Moreover, the rumormonger only needs a much lower level of Apple knowledge or analysis that the commentator does, since (I assume) the rumormonger's *sources* provide most of the information, and too much editorializing is detrimental. Hence I suspect that Mark Gurman is seen as some kind of a threat by some of the heavily pro-Apple commentariat, which would explain the criticism that you're seeing.

RyenDeckard,"""Providing Escapism"" dude you cannot be for real.

You cannot be that reductionist with the concept of ""entertainment"".

The Vision Pro is very specifically not being marketed as an entertainment device because all other vr/ar headsets are, and they are floundering.

Apple is marketing this as a lifestyle device, which inherently must solve a problem or assist in productivity in a way that has not been seen before.

It is doing neither of these things.",2024-02-28 05:52:50,2

I know the Apple Car has been in the works for almost 10 years now, but at least they never really came out and publicly promoted or even teased it. We really only knew of it from leaks. 

Zuckerberg at one point told employees that the company would be going “all-in” on the Metaverse and even renamed the damn company to Meta. I’m not sure if there are figures out there for how much Apple invested in the car project but Meta had spent more than $50B to bring the Metaverse to life, which is almost hard to comprehend given how bad it looked.",2024-02-27 21:17:50,1
