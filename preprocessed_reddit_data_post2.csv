stonks_justgoup,"I'm sure this is in Apple's sights, but like the ""rumored TV"" was for the longest time, I have a feeling the final product will be scaled back far from a car form factor.

It makes more sense that whatever is in the works is a hardware/software product for gathering all types of data inputs revolved around the driving experience to strengthen their inputs and outputs for/from deep learning.

For example, I can totally see a battery management and carOS experience sold as a package deal to struggling auto manufacturers who simply don't have the expertise -- the industry conditions are certainly ripe for an arms race. This will strengthen macOS and iOS battery management tech as well. It makes sense that it runs some future iteration of M1 to further separate Apple's SoC advantage from the pack.  I'm reminded of this article with Apple exec John Giannandrea, [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/)

This data, trained on millions of hours of driving, can produce a 'brain' strong enough to inform a more final form of a product where Apple earns end-to-end control. In a lot of ways, this reminds me of the insights Apple eventually came to with test flighting the Moto ROKR (which famously resulted in Steve's disgust towards carriers, and crafting a carrier playbook for iPhone). Only this time, they are in a way better position to influence the industry.

Going light and impactful with dollars spent gives Apple the benefits of a platform (and everything that comes with being in the Apple ecosystem), without having to front the capital intensive costs of car production. Apple can capture the hardware and software margin on top of a car that's sold and packaged in a way consumers can understand, without having to commit to a single 'car' model -- and at the same time, bolster the Apple ecosystem in a user-friendly way that informs the 'final form' of Apple Car (which won't have 4 wheels to begin with).",2020-12-21 21:41:02,102,im sure apples sights like rumored tv longest time feeling final product scaled back far car form factor makes sense whatever works hardwaresoftware product gathering types data inputs revolved around driving experience strengthen inputs outputs forfrom deep learning example totally see battery management caros experience sold package deal struggling auto manufacturers simply dont expertise industry conditions certainly ripe arms race strengthen macos ios battery management tech well makes sense runs future iteration m1 separate apples soc advantage pack im reminded article apple exec john giannandrea httpsarstechnicacomgadgets202008appleexplainshowitusesmachinelearningacrossiosandsoonmacoshttpsarstechnicacomgadgets202008appleexplainshowitusesmachinelearningacrossiosandsoonmacos data trained millions hours driving produce brain strong enough inform final form product apple earns endtoend control lot ways reminds insights apple eventually came test flighting moto rokr famously resulted steves disgust towards carriers crafting carrier playbook iphone time way better position influence industry going light impactful dollars spent gives apple benefits platform everything comes apple ecosystem without front capital intensive costs car production apple capture hardware software margin top car thats sold packaged way consumers understand without commit single car model time bolster apple ecosystem userfriendly way informs final form apple car wont 4 wheels begin

The logistics of building, shipping, and repairing cars across the globe is an enormous undertaking. Without swallowing an already established manufacturing facility, I just don’t see it happening. Apple might be sitting on a mountain of cash, but that doesn’t mean they are going to risk it for something that would most likely be the largest risk to date on a “product”.

And it’s more than just build an electric car at this point. You need a robust fast charging network, which at this point only Tesla truly has. Electrify America is more and more widespread, but charge speeds are not comparable. And outside America, example Canada where I live, you will be hard pressed to find anything as common as Tesla chargers.

Nathan2055,"As much as I used to agree with you there, having gone from an iPhone 6S to an iPhone XR, they’ve really improved the battery drastically. The XR lasts like 2.5x as long as the 6S did.

On top of that, the iPhone 7 was, IIRC, the last year where they actually made the iPhone thinner. Since then, most of the models have either remained the same or even slightly *increased* the thickness, culminating in the iPhone 12 line actually reverting to the iPhone 4 and 5-style square edges.

The problem is that it’s really difficult to offer massive performance boosts *and* massive battery life increases in the same form factor at the same time. The hardware revision on the Switch managed to double the battery life by upgrading to a newer and faster SoC, but it still targets the same performance that the original model was getting. Because of that, they can reduce the power draw to get additional battery life. Meanwhile, Apple is trying to offer massive yearly performance bumps. They can do that, and keep the battery life generally where it was last year, or they can provide similar performance and much better battery life. Or you can carry a comically oversized brick around with you and get both.

But it *is* disingenuous to say that Apple simply isn’t working on those problem.

Apple won’t beat Tesla on speed or features but they’ll certainly beat them on customer service and quality control. If they make a car they’ll play the long game. They should release a car before their self-driving is perfected though and use the fleet for learning all while severely limiting the self-driving user driving options. Heck, if Apple has their head screwed on their car will have simple functionality such as a way to open the glovebox without needing to use the centre display. Basic stuff such as dials for climate control. Apple adding a Digital Crown as the control method for AirPods Max honestly bodes well for thinking about the prospect of them making a car.

stonks_justgoup,"It's most likely the brain that they're targeting and it won't be a car. My bet is with Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Lexus -- whoever is falling behind in sales but still has consumer mindshare / demographic crossover.

Working in the industry, hardware is incredibly capital intensive (not just materials, but also on long term commitments) and you constantly have to weigh the opportunity cost of capital in the product development process. To break in as a new entrant, you need to break in your product experience into things that look familiar to the consumer or else you front enormous mindshare risk in an attempt to 'create a market'.

It's well known that software marginal costs at scale are close to zero, and the profit is in the ability to rent it out or sell it in an enterprise environment. Apple is no stranger to this advantage they have on both sides and they will use it in powerful ways.",2020-12-21 22:03:15,22,likely brain theyre targeting wont car bet porsche mercedes bmw lexus whoever falling behind sales still consumer mindshare demographic crossover working industry hardware incredibly capital intensive materials also long term commitments constantly weigh opportunity cost capital product development process break new entrant need break product experience things look familiar consumer else front enormous mindshare risk attempt create market well known software marginal costs scale close zero profit ability rent sell enterprise environment apple stranger advantage sides use powerful ways

wetsip,">	It remains unclear who would assemble an Apple-branded car, but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles. And there is still a chance Apple will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker, rather than the iPhone maker selling an Apple-branded car, one of the people added.

Yeah, well, that’s kinda the most important detail here and without it this is a non-story. 

Building a car is not the same as building consumer electronics it’s in a completely different category and contracting that work out is a really weird model because of the volumetric needs of a car manufacturing plant *and* we haven’t even addressed battery manfuacturing something traditional car makers *can not do or have not proven effective at.* Maybe Apple licenses its technology to a traditional auto maker but even that is weird for Apple who loves vertical integration and tight control to optimize for user experience.

Apple often does this kind of leak to drum up excitement and interest for things they haven’t announced— the report of the bezel-less iPhone X two years in advance is an example.
