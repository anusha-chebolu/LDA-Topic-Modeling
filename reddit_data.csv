Opacy,"It’s probably the right move - even with Apple’s deep pockets, building a brand new EV from scratch is hard. Scaling up manufacturing for mass production of that EV is hard. Creating a national or international sales and service network is hard and ridiculously expensive. Even if the car project is dead, I would still love to see Apple take another stab at EVs - maybe instead of going it alone, they would partner with an established manufacturer who would build an “Apple-designed” EV that is a showcase for Apple software - full next gen CarPlay, CarKey support, deep integration with Apple Watch and iPhone etc.

Depending on how serious Apple is about it, they could also do stuff like work with the manufacturer’s dealer network to choose specific dealerships across the country as partners to sell the Apple EV (at a set price Tesla-style with no haggling) and provide service and repairs. Ford is already doing something similar with their dealership network when it comes to selling their EVs (though they are having some difficulty)

YouAboutToLoseYoJob,"To be completely honest, upon my arrival, there were still numerous discussions ongoing regarding the final version of the project. Frankly, nobody was certain whether it would culminate in an autonomous vehicle, a taxi service, an Apple-branded production vehicle, or if we would eventually sell the technology to another entity. The speculation and confusion were rampant, and the constant restructuring led me to believe that this endeavor might not see fruition for another 7 to 8 years.

While my focus was primarily on autonomy, I did catch glimpses of the prototypes for the physical vehicle, notable for its unique steering wheel design resembling more of a flight controller than a conventional wheel.

Moreover, considering the incidents involving other autonomous platforms like Uber, Cruise, and Waymo, there was a prevailing sentiment within the lab that no matter how diligent our efforts, a single mishap could result in prolonged negative publicity. While the memory of the woman killed by an Uber car may have faded for many, and incidents involving Cruise in San Francisco may be overlooked, we couldn't afford anything less than absolute perfection.

In my belief, Our testing procedures far surpassed those of any other vehicle platform, yet from a financial standpoint, I struggled to see the profitability of a potential $80,000 to $100,000 car for Apple, considering profit margins.

bloomberg,"*From Bloomberg News reporter Mark Gurman:*

Apple is canceling a decadelong effort to build an electric car, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.

Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn’t public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.

The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the car team — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.

The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and vehicle designers. It’s possible they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.

The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort called Project Titan that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. You can read the full story [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai), or [sign up](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on) for Mark's Power On newsletter, free to read.",2024-02-27 21:45:31,3

There's a lot of struggle with EV's on things with a) getting electronic parts b) sourcing enough lithium for batteries c) expensive repair costs d) keeping the MSRP down compared to similar ICE cars. 

I was trying to buy a Honda Ioniq5 a couple years ago and I had a down payment and it was delayed 12 months before I just said, screw this, and went and bought an ICE. 

Then there was an article about a guy who owned on in Canada and they were going to charge him 60k in repair costs because the battery needed replacing. 

Mind you the car already sells for 60k and it's...Not a luxrious interior by any means, it's very ""plasticy"". It's fast as hell but that's a ""value"" that wears off after you show it off a few times, sure merging on the highway is great but no one ""needs"" 0-60 in under 4 seconds the majority of the time. Also it had no rear wiper, which was an issue. 

Anyways, just read an article a few days ago where Mercedes is joining a list of other car manufacturers who are scaling back EV production, in what was already a VERY small market (at least in the US/Canada)

Seems like an EV will add 30-50k to most sticker prices and people just don't care THAT much to warrant it.",2024-02-28 11:39:35,2

iMacmatician,"That's why Gruber keeps bringing up the ""Big Hack"" (or at least used to) even though he knows it has nothing to do with Gurman. 

John Gruber is well known for his Apple commentary (and Markdown). He is a longtime and well-respective member of the Apple community and has connections to Apple. He's comfortably in the highest ""tier"" of Apple commentators in terms of social status. While Gruber seems to have some sources (""little birdie""s), *Daring Fireball* is not a rumor site. Hence one can surmise that he knows little about future Apple products aside from what the (public) rumor mill is saying. 

On the other hand, Mark Gurman has sources within Apple, and rather good ones too. To a reasonable extent, he ""knows"" what Apple will do a few weeks to a few years from now. I'd place him at the top tier of rumor sites in the past 20 years, along with *ThinkSecret*, *AppleInsider*, and *9to5Mac* in their heydays. 

The Apple community generally likes to get information about upcoming products for various reasons, and rumors and rumor sites satisfy that itch. Many people can make informed speculation about Apple's future, but without inside sources, it's really hard to sustain the level of accuracy and precision of a good rumor site. 

>It's strange to see his fans carrying around his weird grudges too.\^

And here's where I think the Gruber–Gurman situation comes in. In the Apple sphere, the only person who can be ""better"" than a well-informed commentator is a well-connected rumormonger. Moreover, the rumormonger only needs a much lower level of Apple knowledge or analysis that the commentator does, since (I assume) the rumormonger's *sources* provide most of the information, and too much editorializing is detrimental. Hence I suspect that Mark Gurman is seen as some kind of a threat by some of the heavily pro-Apple commentariat, which would explain the criticism that you're seeing.

Cars are insanely complicated to produce, hence car companies iterate and make small changes over many years. Even something mundane like a door handle is 50+ years of evolution in manufacturing and design.

The supply chain is insane, and the supply chain has a complex supply chain of its own.  Apple has never shipped an entire product line with so many components than a single car ships with.

Apple should focus on technology and license that to car companies to integrate. They get all the perks without the trouble.

Just like how Apple makes cell phones and leaves complex cell networks to other companies. Apple sells them the tech their customers can use on their cars.

This is Tesla’s big mistake. Had Tesla licensed drivetrain technology and drive computing instead of doing it all in house, we’d be talking about monopolistic behavior.

stonks_justgoup,"I'm sure this is in Apple's sights, but like the ""rumored TV"" was for the longest time, I have a feeling the final product will be scaled back far from a car form factor.

It makes more sense that whatever is in the works is a hardware/software product for gathering all types of data inputs revolved around the driving experience to strengthen their inputs and outputs for/from deep learning.

For example, I can totally see a battery management and carOS experience sold as a package deal to struggling auto manufacturers who simply don't have the expertise -- the industry conditions are certainly ripe for an arms race. This will strengthen macOS and iOS battery management tech as well. It makes sense that it runs some future iteration of M1 to further separate Apple's SoC advantage from the pack.  I'm reminded of this article with Apple exec John Giannandrea, [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/)

This data, trained on millions of hours of driving, can produce a 'brain' strong enough to inform a more final form of a product where Apple earns end-to-end control. In a lot of ways, this reminds me of the insights Apple eventually came to with test flighting the Moto ROKR (which famously resulted in Steve's disgust towards carriers, and crafting a carrier playbook for iPhone). Only this time, they are in a way better position to influence the industry.

Going light and impactful with dollars spent gives Apple the benefits of a platform (and everything that comes with being in the Apple ecosystem), without having to front the capital intensive costs of car production. Apple can capture the hardware and software margin on top of a car that's sold and packaged in a way consumers can understand, without having to commit to a single 'car' model -- and at the same time, bolster the Apple ecosystem in a user-friendly way that informs the 'final form' of Apple Car (which won't have 4 wheels to begin with).",2020-12-21 21:41:02,104

Apple might be sitting on a mountain of cash, but that doesn’t mean they are going to risk it for something that would most likely be the largest risk to date on a “product”.

And it’s more than just build an electric car at this point. You need a robust fast charging network, which at this point only Tesla truly has. Electrify America is more and more widespread, but charge speeds are not comparable. And outside America, example Canada where I live, you will be hard pressed to find anything as common as Tesla chargers.

Nathan2055,"As much as I used to agree with you there, having gone from an iPhone 6S to an iPhone XR, they’ve really improved the battery drastically. The XR lasts like 2.5x as long as the 6S did.

On top of that, the iPhone 7 was, IIRC, the last year where they actually made the iPhone thinner. Since then, most of the models have either remained the same or even slightly *increased* the thickness, culminating in the iPhone 12 line actually reverting to the iPhone 4 and 5-style square edges.

The problem is that it’s really difficult to offer massive performance boosts *and* massive battery life increases in the same form factor at the same time. The hardware revision on the Switch managed to double the battery life by upgrading to a newer and faster SoC, but it still targets the same performance that the original model was getting. Because of that, they can reduce the power draw to get additional battery life. Meanwhile, Apple is trying to offer massive yearly performance bumps. They can do that, and keep the battery life generally where it was last year, or they can provide similar performance and much better battery life. Or you can carry a comically oversized brick around with you and get both.

But it *is* disingenuous to say that Apple simply isn’t working on those problem. The fact that the M1 MacBook Air has 12+ hours of battery life while still offering performance equivalent to a desktop PC is a testament to that.",2020-12-22 01:44:36,38

Heck, if Apple has their head screwed on their car will have simple functionality such as a way to open the glovebox without needing to use the centre display. Basic stuff such as dials for climate control. Apple adding a Digital Crown as the control method for AirPods Max honestly bodes well for thinking about the prospect of them making a car.

The idea of being in control of that experience probably tantalisers the designers at Apple.",2020-12-21 22:39:13,23

stonks_justgoup,"It's most likely the brain that they're targeting and it won't be a car. My bet is with Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Lexus -- whoever is falling behind in sales but still has consumer mindshare / demographic crossover.

Working in the industry, hardware is incredibly capital intensive (not just materials, but also on long term commitments) and you constantly have to weigh the opportunity cost of capital in the product development process. To break in as a new entrant, you need to break in your product experience into things that look familiar to the consumer or else you front enormous mindshare risk in an attempt to 'create a market'.

It's well known that software marginal costs at scale are close to zero, and the profit is in the ability to rent it out or sell it in an enterprise environment. Apple is no stranger to this advantage they have on both sides and they will use it in powerful ways.",2020-12-21 22:03:15,21

stonks_justgoup,"There are people in the industry who manufacture rumors for various reasons -- whether that's to gain leverage on a partner, test flight ideas for consumer feedback, identify leakers, etc. Apple branded car doesn't necessarily mean from the rubber up. It could be a co-branded project.

People also infamously said the iPhone would have two keyboards, two batteries, and take after the design of the LG Chocolate -- while also saying (and trying to prove via photos) that the 5th generation iPod would have the same body with a touch screen and that it wasn't going to make its way into the iPhone. We know how that one turned out..

As someone who has been following Apple's every move since 2005 who now works in this industry, I wouldn't take much stock in those rumors. History has proven over and over again that the rumor mill is not a reliable source of information, with exception to Ming Chi Kuo, who has crazy supply chain contacts. Plans change, and Apple is run by people who are thinking in decades -- not to hit an arbitrary consumer/media expectation by 2024.",2020-12-21 22:12:58,21

Also, everything Apple makes is priced towards the top of what a very large market is willing to pay for it.

Most people cannot and will never be able to afford a new Porsche or Mercedes-Benz product. Most people can afford an iPhone, even if it's a splurge. I bet they'll actually shoot for products that match the premium feel of everything they make but it'll be more in the $30k-$60k range than the high-end(for cars).",2020-12-21 23:04:26,18

wetsip,">	It remains unclear who would assemble an Apple-branded car, but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles. And there is still a chance Apple will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker, rather than the iPhone maker selling an Apple-branded car, one of the people added.

Yeah, well, that’s kinda the most important detail here and without it this is a non-story. 

Building a car is not the same as building consumer electronics it’s in a completely different category and contracting that work out is a really weird model because of the volumetric needs of a car manufacturing plant *and* we haven’t even addressed battery manfuacturing something traditional car makers *can not do or have not proven effective at.* Maybe Apple licenses its technology to a traditional auto maker but even that is weird for Apple who loves vertical integration and tight control to optimize for user experience. 

This is a huge leap and this story gives us no details.
