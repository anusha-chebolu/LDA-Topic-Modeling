stonks_justgoup,"I'm sure this is in Apple's sights, but like the ""rumored TV"" was for the longest time, I have a feeling the final product will be scaled back far from a car form factor.

It makes more sense that whatever is in the works is a hardware/software product for gathering all types of data inputs revolved around the driving experience to strengthen their inputs and outputs for/from deep learning.

For example, I can totally see a battery management and carOS experience sold as a package deal to struggling auto manufacturers who simply don't have the expertise -- the industry conditions are certainly ripe for an arms race. This will strengthen macOS and iOS battery management tech as well. It makes sense that it runs some future iteration of M1 to further separate Apple's SoC advantage from the pack.  I'm reminded of this article with Apple exec John Giannandrea, [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/)

This data, trained on millions of hours of driving, can produce a 'brain' strong enough to inform a more final form of a product where Apple earns end-to-end control. In a lot of ways, this reminds me of the insights Apple eventually came to with test flighting the Moto ROKR (which famously resulted in Steve's disgust towards carriers, and crafting a carrier playbook for iPhone). Only this time, they are in a way better position to influence the industry.

Going light and impactful with dollars spent gives Apple the benefits of a platform (and everything that comes with being in the Apple ecosystem), without having to front the capital intensive costs of car production. Apple can capture the hardware and software margin on top of a car that's sold and packaged in a way consumers can understand, without having to commit to a single 'car' model -- and at the same time, bolster the Apple ecosystem in a user-friendly way that informs the 'final form' of Apple Car (which won't have 4 wheels to begin with).",2020-12-21 21:41:02,102

Apple might be sitting on a mountain of cash, but that doesn’t mean they are going to risk it for something that would most likely be the largest risk to date on a “product”.

And it’s more than just build an electric car at this point. You need a robust fast charging network, which at this point only Tesla truly has. Electrify America is more and more widespread, but charge speeds are not comparable. And outside America, example Canada where I live, you will be hard pressed to find anything as common as Tesla chargers.

Nathan2055,"As much as I used to agree with you there, having gone from an iPhone 6S to an iPhone XR, they’ve really improved the battery drastically. The XR lasts like 2.5x as long as the 6S did.

On top of that, the iPhone 7 was, IIRC, the last year where they actually made the iPhone thinner. Since then, most of the models have either remained the same or even slightly *increased* the thickness, culminating in the iPhone 12 line actually reverting to the iPhone 4 and 5-style square edges.

The problem is that it’s really difficult to offer massive performance boosts *and* massive battery life increases in the same form factor at the same time. The hardware revision on the Switch managed to double the battery life by upgrading to a newer and faster SoC, but it still targets the same performance that the original model was getting. Because of that, they can reduce the power draw to get additional battery life. Meanwhile, Apple is trying to offer massive yearly performance bumps. They can do that, and keep the battery life generally where it was last year, or they can provide similar performance and much better battery life. Or you can carry a comically oversized brick around with you and get both.

But it *is* disingenuous to say that Apple simply isn’t working on those problem. The fact that the M1 MacBook Air has 12+ hours of battery life while still offering performance equivalent to a desktop PC is a testament to that.",2020-12-22 01:44:36,38

Building a car is not the same as building consumer electronics it’s in a completely different category and contracting that work out is a really weird model because of the volumetric needs of a car manufacturing plant *and* we haven’t even addressed battery manfuacturing something traditional car makers *can not do or have not proven effective at.* Maybe Apple licenses its technology to a traditional auto maker but even that is weird for Apple who loves vertical integration and tight control to optimize for user experience. 

This is a huge leap and this story gives us no details.

You should know that when an organization like Reuters, Bloomberg or WSJ come out with a report like this, it’s likely because they’ve been fed by a reliable source within Apple. These rumors are frequently accurate, if perhaps off by a detail due to possible issues translating what they’ve been told for their report. Apple often does this kind of leak to drum up excitement and interest for things they haven’t announced— the report of the bezel-less iPhone X two years in advance is an example.

Apple will need to spill the beans about the Car earlier than they typically do, due to the public nature of this kind of production. It’s going to be a bit different, but in the end it will just be Apple’s way of doing a car. Very exciting time.",2020-12-21 22:27:10,13

ojedaforpresident,"They make money on that. I'd be surprised if the classic iPad isn't one of the bigger money makers. Not the most base model, but the ones with extra storage. A 50$-100$ markup for adding in a chip that ups the component price by 10-15$, cha-ching. 

The design for these, they have down to a science, so they're relatively cheap to engineer, and the sales numbers scale exceptionally because they're so affordable.",2020-12-21 22:16:36,5

stonks_justgoup,"Apple would own both hardware and software still.

WhiteyMcBrown,"Apple has a huge shot here. This is a big business opportunity(potentially hundreds of billions) and I don’t think Apple will half-step. I appreciate everything Musk had done for electric cars (and online payments and space exploration), but I deeply despise his personal brand. I find him, as a personality, super lame. I know many do not but if Apple’s able to even match Tesla, some will go with the Apple car. I already picked my BMW over a Tesla for this reason. I don’t want to be part of Team Musk. 

Either way. More competition is good.",2020-12-22 00:28:11,4

I_LOVE_MOM,"I know guys who work at Tesla and Apple. Let's just say the Tesla guys work a lot harder and get more done due to the company culture set by Elon. Apple might have a hard time beating that no matter how much money they throw at it. Things may have been different in the Jobs era.

wetsip,"I don’t disagree with the vision but the execution timeline here makes this really untenable especially if any volume manufacturing for Apple is 36-48 months out and especially if they plan to rely on sourcing vehicle batteries from a 3rd party (who???) 

The idea that Apple can scale a “fleet” for learning sounds great, this has been Tesla’s approach, but while Tesla is expecting to produce millions of cars per year by 2024, Apple will just be starting. It takes years to scale automobile manufacturing and if they want to produce electric vehicles that same reality is true for batteries. Even if you have billions and billions, building these facilities is on the order of years.

To add conservative estimates project half of all vehicles by 2030 will be BEV. Apple will have a hell of time trying to compete for material sourcing against Tesla, Daimler, Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, GM....",2020-12-21 23:12:55,4

pixel_of_moral_decay,"I think a lot of people would pay for a vehicle ""powered by Apple"" or ""powered by Tesla"".

But figuring out how to stamp out a pickup truck that can handle 15 years of pickup life is not easy.  It's really not.  Tesla can't even get body panels perfectly lined up.  The last vehicle that I believe had that issue was the Yugo.

That's how far back and how budget you have to go to find someone who's had the same problems Tesla has.  A Yugoslavian car manufacturer from 30+ years ago.

Meanwhile, on the Technology side Tesla is years ahead of anyone.

Now imagine if they partnered with BMW to offer a Tesla powered version of 3 series or X3.  Tesla drive train and smarts.  BMW body/interior wrapped around it.  They wouldn't be able to meet demand for the orders. No question about it.

Next partner with Honda and do the same with the Accord/Civic/Pilot lines.  Same deal.  Honda body/interior with Tesla drivetrain/smarts.  Or Toyota.  Both companies well known for vehicles that last forever and have rock solid bodies on a budget.

If Apple's playing it smart, they'll go this route and snap up the better partners into exclusive deals.",2020-12-21 23:02:55,4

bicameral_mind,"Definitely isn't.  The base Model 3 is a tough value proposition, because it lacks so much of what you would want from a Tesla, while still costing as much as a full spec midrange sedan like a Passat.
